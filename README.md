# gistman

A CLI tool to manage your gists on Github

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/gistman.png?compact=true)](https://npmjs.org/package/gistman)

## Prerequisites

You will need to create a personal token with access scope set to `gist` from the [Github settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new). I will be working on a login flow to eliminate this step, but until then

## Usage Demo
